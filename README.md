# Aim
Task is to predict the sentiment of the tweet i.e. positive, negative or neutral.
# Dataset
Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset, which contains data for over 14000 tweets.
# In this repository
* `dataset.csv` - Dataset used for training and testing the model.
* `twitter_sentiments.ipnyb` - Jupyter Notebook
* `emogi_sentiment.csv` - CSV file for getting the sentiment of the emogi used in tweets.
# Required external libraries
* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `sklearn`
* `nltk`
# Future 
I hope to further increase its efficiency by training it on a larger dataset. Also planning to use different classifiers and observing the effect of emogis.
